# Role Issues and Solutions for TechHub Shop Owner Access

## Issues Identified:

1. **Role Value Inconsistency**: 
   - Registration form was using `ROLE_SHOP_OWNER` 
   - Role utilities expect `SHOP_OWNER`
   - Profile display didn't recognize `SHOP_OWNER` format

2. **Profile Display Issue**:
   - Profile component's `getRoleLabel` function defaulted to "Customer"
   - Didn't handle `SHOP_OWNER` role format properly

3. **Shop Dashboard Access**:
   - Route exists at `/dashboard/shop`
   - Navbar has "Shop Dashboard" link for shop owners
   - ProtectedRoute properly checks for `SHOP_OWNER` role

## Fixed:

1. ✅ **Updated Login component** to use consistent role values (`SHOP_OWNER` instead of `ROLE_SHOP_OWNER`)
2. ✅ **Fixed Profile component** to properly display "Shop Owner" for users with `SHOP_OWNER` role
3. ✅ **Added debug components** for testing role functionality

## Testing Steps:

### For Existing Users:
1. Go to `/test-role` to see current role detection
2. If role shows incorrectly, logout and login again
3. Check if "Shop Dashboard" appears in the user menu (top-right)

### For New Users:
1. Register as "Shop Owner" (should now work correctly)
2. After registration, should redirect to `/dashboard/shop`
3. Profile should show "Shop Owner" instead of "Customer"

## Debug URLs:
- `/test-role` - Simple role test and navigation
- `/debug-role` - Comprehensive role debugging
- `/dashboard/shop` - Shop owner dashboard (requires SHOP_OWNER role)

## How to Access Shop Dashboard:

### Method 1: Direct URL
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/shop`

### Method 2: User Menu
1. Click the avatar/user icon in top-right corner of navbar
2. Look for "Shop Dashboard" option in the dropdown menu
3. Click "Shop Dashboard"

### Method 3: Navigation after Login
Shop owners should automatically be redirected to the dashboard after login

## If Still Having Issues:

1. **Clear browser data**: Logout, clear localStorage, login again
2. **Check network tab**: Look for 401/403 errors when accessing shop dashboard
3. **Use debug pages**: Visit `/test-role` to see what role the system detects
4. **Backend check**: Ensure user was actually created with SHOP_OWNER role in database

## Backend Role Values:
The backend should use these role values:
- `0` or `"ROLE_CUSTOMER"` for customers  
- `1` or `"SHOP_OWNER"` for shop owners
- `2` or `"ADMIN"` for administrators
